            <h1>Upcoming Race Events and Race Results</h1>
            <p>Joining a race makes a biker excited and look forward to it because this is where he can prove his skills 
                and test his abilities against other bikers. Releasing the beast mode out of you on the race track. 
                During races, bikers from all over your region gather to compete and to have a good time with their
                 shared hobbies. Going from place to place every season. Some bikers go into a race not to compete, but 
                 to give support to their friends who are in the competition or professional players they admire who are 
                 also in the competition. Bike competition has different vibes. It gives you the  thrill even if youâ€™re 
                 just a spectator. But being in the race as a participant is way crazier. </p>
