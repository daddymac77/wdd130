        I WANT TO RIDE MY BIKE  goal is to always be excited to ride your bike. No matter how busy you are in your life or no matter what kind of bike you are riding. Road bikes, Cross country bikes, dirt jump bikes, enduro bikes, free ride bikes,  or downhill bikes. There are a lot of bikes to choose from. It depends on your abilities, likes, and affordability. Some got an extra job just to meet their needs in their hobbies. Especially nowadays good quality bikes are becoming more pricey. It does not matter what kind of bike you are riding, as long as you’re enjoying it. It does not matter if you’re a pro or if you’re a newbie as long as you’re surrounded by friends who support your hobby.  You will be thrilled to ride your bike as if it is always your first time to ride.

        In life we are always busy, busy at work, busy at school, busy at home doing our house chores and anything else that we could think of. But no matter how busy we are, if we are excited to ride our bike, we always look forward to our free day riding out  on those saddles. We marked those calendars, and set notifications for us to be reminded.  We all have our reasons to be excited to ride our bikes.We always find ways and reasons to get on those bikes. New trail, new gears and accessories, new bike group, and of course a new bike.

      <h3>Bike Race Events</h3>
      <p>
        Joining a race makes a biker excited and look forward to it because this is where he can prove his skills and test his abilities against other bikers. Releasing the beast mode out of you on the race track. During races, bikers from all over your region gather to compete and to have a good time with their shared hobbies. Going from place to place every season. Some bikers go into a race not to compete, but to give support to their friends who are in the competition or professional players they admire who are also in the competition. Bike competition has different vibes. It gives you the  thrill even if you’re just a spectator. But being in the race as a participant is way crazier.
